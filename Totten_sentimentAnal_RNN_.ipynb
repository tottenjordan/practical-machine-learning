It is worth noting the success of adding dropout to the multilayer RNN models. In each Language Model, simply adding layers actually reduced the testing accuracy by an average of ~5%. When comparing the models with additional layers, including dropout in each layer increased the testing accuracy by an average of ~9%. The impacts to training accuracy were also significant as the training accuracy in RNN-C was lower than that of RNN-B by an average of 31%. Reduced training accuracy suggests the model was not overfitting during training and this likely contributed to better learning (as shown in the higher test accuracies).\n"
