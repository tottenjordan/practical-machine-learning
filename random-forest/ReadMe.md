### Exploring Random Forests

* Bootstrap aggregation or 'bagging' introduces random sampling from the training data for diversity
* 'Pasting' is when sampling is performed without replacement
* Cross validation resamples specified sections of the data producing validation sets from the training data without resampling 
* A group of predictors is called an 'ensemble'
* Random forests are considered an 'ensemble learning method'
