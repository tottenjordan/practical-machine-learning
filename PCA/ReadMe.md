### Exploring Principal Components Analysis

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm. 
* First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then it projects the data onto it
* The direction of the principal components is not stable: if you perturb the training set slightly and run PCA again, some of the new PCs may point in the opposite direction of the original PCs



* Fun fact: anyone you know is probably an extremist in at least one dimension (e.g., how much sugar they put in their coffee), if you consider enough dimensions
