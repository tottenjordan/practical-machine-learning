This repo holds projects exploring various linear regression techniques

Markup : ### Topics Explored ###

* An underfit model is a model that is too simple to learn the underlying structure of the data
* An overfit model is a model that performs well o nthe train set but cannot generalize well (perform well on the test set)
* _Precision_ and _Recall_ evaluates the metrics of a confusion matrix (false negative, true negative, true positive, false positive)
  * High Precision_and low Recall detects only true positives and has some false negatives
  * Low Precision and high Recall detects all true positives, but has more false positives 
* _Bias_ / _Variance_ is a tradeoff error
  * Bias refers to eror from worng assumptions or generalizing. It usually leads to underfit models
  * Variance refers to error from sensitive models. It usually leads to overfit models
