### Exploring Neural Networks

* Describe how artifical neural netowrks are consturcted from logical connections of artifical neurons
* Describe alternative functions, including step, logit, hyperbolic tangent, and rectified linuear units (ReLu)
* Explain the roles of training, validation, and test samples in the development and evaluation of artificial neural networks
* Demonstrate ANN's in classification and regression
